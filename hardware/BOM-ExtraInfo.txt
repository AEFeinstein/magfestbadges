1) If you break anything, I'll send you more!  First shipment of whatever you
break is free!

2) There's a fair number of parts, it may take some patience.

3) You will need a soldering iron and some solder, OR solder paste and a hot
air gun or a toaster oven.

4) If you have any trouble, feel free to contact me via facebook or my phone
at 443-838-2702.

I've packed the parts in individual bags to help prevent confusion.  You will
find a few special parts, but these classes of parts:

D# -> LED - you must orient these correctly.  The tiny green dot on the
  surface of the LED will always be on the right side.

R# -> These are resistors, white on one side, black with white numbering on
  the other.

C# -> These are capacitors, pale gray to beige, and unmarked other than dots
  I've placed on some of them.

I've placed a few extra of a few parts in everyone's bags, so even if you
damage one, there's a chance there may be more of that exact part.

Open and place only one bag at a time.

For soldering, either: (Cliff notes! Look up youtube videos on this for more!)

A) Place the part on the board, use a pair of tweezers or toothpick to hold
the part down.  Use a soldering wet a soldering iron tip with some solder,
and apply the bead of solder on one of the sides of the part.

or

B) Place the part on the board, place the soldering iron tip at the junction
of the part and the board, and feed a small amount of solder in.
